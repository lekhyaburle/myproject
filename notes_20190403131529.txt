Another way :: You can create a batch file and put following code to batch file. Its first run netstat command to get processId for port 9797. And then set it into a variable.

@ECHO OFF                                                                              
FOR /F "tokens=5" %%T IN ('netstat -a -n -o ^| findstr "9797" ') DO (
SET /A ProcessId=%%T) &GOTO SkipLine                                                   
:SkipLine                                                                              
echo ProcessId = %ProcessId%
